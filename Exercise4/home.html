        <h1>Bicycles</h1>

        <p>Do you know a child that does not want to ride a bike? Well I do not know anyone. This means I was a healthy young boy like others who were willing to learn how to ride the bicycle. I remember that process so I think I was around five years old, to learn riding a bike on my own without the training wheels was an exciting experience.</p>
        <p>At that moment I did not think about bicycle accidents at all and consequences. Finally, when you learn how to ride the bike it lasts forever and that why is so important to do it at childhood age. I was very excited when my parents bought me a bike. This meant that it was about time for me to learn riding a bike on my own.</p>
        <p>He continued to encourage me to keep trying, and, after falling off several times, I was finally able to ride my bicycle up and down the sidewalk in front of my house without any help from my father whatsoever. I learned that riding a bicycle was a lot easier than I could have ever dreamed. By buying me the knee and elbow pads and telling me that they would help protect me, my father helped to diminish my fear of riding a bicycle.</p>

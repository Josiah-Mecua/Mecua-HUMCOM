    <h2>Exercise 17 question's answers</h2>

    <h3>b. What is the output? Explain.</h3>
    <p>Today is another busy day!</p>
    <p>The reason why this is the output is because the first value assigned was overwritten by the second assignment value</p>

    <h3>c. Replace var with let. Save the html document and refresh the web page.</h3>
    <p>It still has the same output</p>

    <h3>d. Replace  let  with  const.  Save  the  html  document  and  refresh  the  web  page.  Describe  the 
        output. Explain </h3>
    <p>Here is
        some text</p>
    <p>The output is the first value assigned because the variable is declared as constanst therfore no matter how much the value is attempted to be reassigned it will still remain the same because it is a constant value</p>

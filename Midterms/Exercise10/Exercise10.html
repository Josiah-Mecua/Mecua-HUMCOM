                <td><p>Do you know a child that does not want to ride a bike? Well I do not know anyone. This means I was a healthy young boy like 
                    others who were willing to learn how to ride the bicycle. I remember that process so I think I was around five years old, 
                    to learn riding a bike on my own without the training wheels was an exciting experience.</p>
        
                <p>History: <br> Cycling as a sport officially began on May 31, 1868, with a 1,200-metre (1,312-yard) race between the fountains 
                    and the entrance of Saint-Cloud Park (near Paris). The winner was James Moore, an 18-year-old expatriate Englishman from Paris. 
                    On November 7, 1869, the first city-to-city race was held between Paris and Rouen; again Moore was the winner, having covered 
                    the 135 km (84 miles) in 10 hours 25 minutes, including time spent walking his bicycle up the steeper hills. While road racing 
                    became common within a few years in continental Europe, in England the deteriorated conditions of the roads made them unsuitable,
                     and therefore the sport there focused on the track or time trials.</p>
        
                <p>Definition: <br> cycling, use of a bicycle for sport, recreation, or transportation. The sport of cycling consists of 
                    professional and amateur races, which are held mostly in continental Europe, the United States, and Asia. The recreational 
                    use of the bicycle is widespread in Europe and the United States. Use of the bicycle as a mode of transportation is 
                    particularly important in non-Western nations and in flatter countries, some of which, like the Netherlands, have a 
                    widespread system of bicycle paths.</p></td>

        <h2>Cycling is Used in Many Ways:</h2> 

        <br><br>

        <h3>Doping</h3>
        <p>Track racing events include the sprint, the pursuit, the one-kilometre time trial, the points race, and the keirin, or 
            motor-paced race. Keirin is especially popular in Japan because betting on the outcome is legal there, much like a horse or 
            dog race. Some European track stars ride on the keirin circuit in Japan, both for the experience and for the salary. 
            Cyclo-cross, or cross-country racing, established in the mid-1920s, covers rough terrain that may require racers to dismount 
            and walk or run with their bicycles. Mountain biking, over rough terrain, but usually downhill rather than on the flat, is 
            increasingly popular. One difference between cyclo-cross and mountain-bike racing is that cyclo-cross riders are allowed to 
            ride up to three bicycles during a race, whereas in mountain-bike competition the cyclist must carry all the tools necessary 
            to fix the bicycle, as only one bicycle may be used during a race. One other recent form of racing is bicycle motocross (BMX) 
            racing, which can be traced to motocross racing. Racers (children and adults) ride on dirt tracks which feature a large number
             of jumps and turns. BMX racing is very popular in the United States, Europe, and Australia. In 2008 BMX racing made its 
             Olympic debut at the Beijing Games in the form of a men’s individual race and a women’s individual race.</p>

        <h3>Doping</h3>
        <p>The use of performance-enhancing drugs is considered to be widespread in cycling, especially after the scandal that shook the 
            Tour de France in 1998 and resulted in the expulsion of one of the leading teams (the Festina team). To circumvent the 
            medications prohibited by the UCI, many professional teams and individual riders employ doctors to administer drugs that are 
            difficult to detect, such as erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that acts to increase the level of red blood cells and thus the 
            flow of oxygen to muscles. The UCI periodically checks riders for the level of red cells in their blood, with a limit of 50 
            percent (55 percent for riders from high-altitude regions); anything above that is regarded as an indication of the use of 
            EPO and carries a two-year suspension. Stimulants and antifatigue drugs such as amphetamines are detectable and therefore 
            outmoded performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

        <h3>Recreation</h3>
        <p>In modern times, recreational cycling has been a cornerstone in fitness campaigns, especially in the United States, where more 
            than 65 million people are believed to ride regularly, including more than 6 million who use bicycles to commute. Bicycle and 
            touring clubs abound in Europe, especially in France, Belgium, Italy, and England. Touring by bicycle (cyclotourism) is also 
            on the increase worldwide. Bicycle paths have been created on the streets of many cities and in national as well as municipal
            parks, and in the United States more than 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of abandoned railroad corridors have been turned into 
            bicycle paths.</p>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p>Since its invention, the bicycle has always been an inexpensive and democratic form of transportation. The advent of the 
            automobile slowed the growth of cycling as a means of conveyance in some Western societies, whereas in China and Southeast 
            Asia the bicycle has remained a very popular form of transportation. In Africa and several central European nations many 
            people travel by bicycle. In the 1990s citizens and city planners in industrialized nations began to question the role of the 
            automobile in urban life; some observers blamed the problem of suburban sprawl in countries such as the United States 
            directly on the rise of automobile-based planning and designs. International groups such as Critical Mass formed to encourage 
            traffic laws and city design more conducive to cycling.</p>
